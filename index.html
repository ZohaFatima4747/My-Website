           Hi, I'm Zoha Fatima, a passionate web design and development student from Vehari, 
           Punjab,Pakistan. Currently pursuing an Associate Degree Program in Web Design and 
           Development at Virtual University, I am excited to build a career in the dynamic
          field of web development.

          I particularly enjoy frontend development, where I can combine creativity
          with technical skills to craft visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
          I am eager to deepen my knowledge in this area while continually experimenting
           with layouts, colors, and animations to create engaging user experiences.
            
          I am committed to learning more alongside my studies and gaining hands-on
          experience in frontend development. My goal is to become a professional web
          developer, contributing to innovative projects that make
          a difference.</pre>
